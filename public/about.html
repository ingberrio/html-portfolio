<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Eduard Berrio. I began my career as a software engineer in 2013, primarily focusing on PHP development.</p>

<p>Currently, I am enthusiastically diving into learning new technologies and expanding my skill set. One of my latest endeavors is exploring the MERN stack, which encompasses MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Embracing this powerful combination of technologies allows me to develop robust and scalable web applications.</p>

<p>I am excited about the endless possibilities and the ability to leverage the full potential of MERN to create innovative solutions. Continuously seeking new knowledge and staying updated with the latest trends in the tech industry is a fundamental aspect of my professional growth and development.</p>

<p>My interests include dark mode, open source projects, and engaging in side projects. During my free time, I enjoy activities such as Netflix, travel, and including new restaurants.</p>
